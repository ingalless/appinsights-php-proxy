# appinsights-php-proxy

I'm making this application for a couple reasons:

Firstly, I've always wanted to have live metrics from a PHP application.
Because PHP doesn't have a runtime we can't run a server which pings messages
we need to enrich it with an agent which handles sending the pulse messages.

Secondly, I want to write a project in Rust using an area I understand.

So here it is, jank and all!
